\begin{frame}{MySQL's role inside OpenStack}

\textit{MySQL} database assumes a core role in the set of support softwares
inside OpenStack and is mainly used:

\begin{itemize}
\item for storing the state of the OpenStack cluster (VMs, users, volumes, tokens, etc), 
\item in the workflow of handling the various service requests (e.g. starting a new instance, creating a volume).
\end{itemize}

Alternative of MySQL inside OpenStack is MariaDB.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RabbitMQ's role inside OpenStack}

The \textit{RabbitMQ} messaging system is the second core support software 
inside OpenStack and is mainly used:

\begin{itemize}
\item to provide a communication layer between the different stack components, 
\item as a consequence to enable the collaboration between the components.
\end{itemize} 

Alternatives of RabbitMQ inside OpenStack are Qpid and ZeroMQ.

\begin{frame}{MySQL \& RabbitMQ interaction 2/2}

Example: provisioning of a new instance

\begin{itemize}
\item a client sends a POST request to nova-api for a VM provisioning,
\item nova-api writes an entry in the database,
\item nova-api posts then a JSON message in RabbitMQ queue (the message is for nova-scheduler),
\item nova-scheduler reads the JSON message from the queue,
\item it examines the overall cluster situation,
\item nova-scheduler then decides which compute should start the VM and posts JSON message in its RabbitMQ queue,
\item nova-compute gathers then the request information (from the RabbitMQ and DB) and proceeds with the VM provisioning.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{MySQL High Availabiltiy}

MySQL is one of the most critical components in the OpenStack installation because 
it contains the state of the whole Stack.

\vspace{5 mm}

Having MySQL in HA becomes almost a requirement. OpenStack's recommended way to 
do it is by using DRBD and Pacemaker. An alternative is using a Galera cluster 
which should become the state-of-the-art in the near future.

link provides more information.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RabbitMQ High Availabiltiy}

RabbitMQ can be configured in HA to prevent communication failure between the OpenStack components.

\vspace{5 mm}

This can be achieved again, like in the case with MySQL, by using DRBD and Pacemaker. 
An alternative method, by using two active-active mirrored servers is also becoming important.

\begin{frame}{Notes and Remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Installation of MySQL and RabbitMQ is really straight forward
and requires limited intervention. 
\item Configuration of RabbitMQ is limited to changing the default passwd and the bind address.
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Conf. file is \texttt{/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf}
          \item Logs directory is: \texttt{/var/log/rabbitmq} 
      \end{itemize} 
\item Configuration of MySQL requires a little bit more than RabbitMQ.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Conf. file is: \texttt{/etc/mysql/my.cnf}
        \item Logs directory is: \texttt{/var/log/mysql}
      \end{itemize}
\item We will see everything in more detail during the tutorial.
\end{itemize}
